We would like to know who were our top 10 paying customers, how many payments they made on a monthly basis during 2007, 
and what was the amount of the monthly payments. 
Can you write a query to capture the customer name, month and year of payment, and total payment amount for each month by these top 10 paying customers




*************************************
SELECT CONCAT(t.first_name,' ',t.last_name) AS Full_name,
		DATE_TRUNC('month',t.payment_date) AS pay_mon,
		COUNT(t.payment_date) AS pay_count_per_mon,
		SUM(t.amount) AS pay_amount
FROM (SELECT *
	FROM customer c
	JOIN payment y
	ON c.customer_id=y.customer_id)t
	WHERE (t.payment_date BETWEEN '2007-01-01' AND '2008-01-01')
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 4 DESC
LIMIT 10;
